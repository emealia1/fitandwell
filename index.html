			<h2>Healthy menus and shopping</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Your shopping strategies should focus on fresh and unprocessed foods. That means spending more time in the produce section, where you can stock up on fruits and vegetables.</li>
				<li>Keep an eye out too for whole grains and low-fat dairy products.</li>
				<li>Also be sure to check out the farmers market during the growing season to see what local produce is available.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Nutritional supplements</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Nutritional supplements are meant to complement a healthy diet, not replace it.</li>
				<li>If you're generally healthy and eat a wide variety of foods, you probably don't need nutritional supplements. In certain cases, however, fortified foods and dietary supplements may be useful in providing one or more nutrients.</li>
				<li>You may also want to consider a nutritional supplement if you don't eat enough healthy foods or don't eat a healthy variety of foods.</li>

				<li>Aerobic activities like running, cycling, and swimming strengthen your heart and increase your endurance.</li>
